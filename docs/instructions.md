# Welcome to LNDg - A Power-User LND Auto-Rebalancer
## PLEASE NOTE: This auto-rebalancing service has been developed specifically for use by LND Routing Node Operators. 
Manual Re-Balancing can be achieved using Ride the Lightning or Thunderhub.

The objective of the Auto-Rebalancer is to automatically "refill" the liquidity on the local side (i.e. OUTBOUND) of profitable and lucarative channels. So that, when a forward comes in from another node there is always enough liquidity to route the payment and in return collect the desired routing fees.

**LNDg is *very* useful if you are a vendor accepting lightning payments, constantly looking for inbound liquidity, or a lightning spender constantly looking for outbound liquiduty.**
## Instructions for LNDg
