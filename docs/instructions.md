# Welcome to LNDg - A Power-User LND Auto-Rebalancer
## PLEASE NOTE: This service has been developed specifically for LND Routing Node Operators. Manual Re-Balancing can be achieved using Ride the Lightning or Thunderhub.

The objective of the Auto-Rebalancer is to automatically "refill" the liquidity on the local side (i.e. OUTBOUND) of profitable and lucarative channels. So that, when a forward comes in from another node there is always enough liquidity to route the payment and in return collect the desired routing fees.
